# Virtual Classroom — AWS Static Web + Flask Backend

**Simple Virtual Classroom** is a lightweight project that serves study materials organized by subject. It uses an S3 bucket to store files (each subject is a folder), an AWS RDS MySQL instance for user data, and an EC2-hosted Flask backend that exposes simple signup/login and course-list APIs. The front-end is a static site (served from S3 or another static host) that talks to the Flask APIs.

## Features

* Student and teacher signup/login.
* Students: view study materials grouped by subject.
* Teachers: upload study materials to existing or new subject folders in S3.
* Backend: Flask API that reads/writes user data in MySQL RDS and lists objects in S3.

## Architecture

* Static front-end: hosted separately (S3 static website / CloudFront)
* Backend: Flask app running on EC2 (or any host)
* Database: AWS RDS (MySQL)
* Storage: AWS S3 for documents and course folders

## Repository structure (suggested)

/ (repo root)
├─ app.py                # Flask app (your provided file)
├─ requirements.txt      # pip dependencies

├─ README.md
└─ frontend/             # (optional) static frontend files
```

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* pip
* An AWS account with:

  * S3 bucket (with CORS allowed for your frontend origin)
  * RDS MySQL instance
  * EC2 instance (or ECS) to run Flask, or use Elastic Beanstalk
  * IAM role or programmatic credentials for S3 access

## Deployment (high-level) — AWS

1. Create an RDS MySQL instance and run the `users` table creation SQL.
2. Create an S3 bucket and upload subject folders / files.
3. Launch an EC2 instance and attach an IAM role allowing S3 access (or configure AWS keys as env vars).
4. Install Python, clone the repo, set environment variables, and run the Flask app (use gunicorn + systemd or Docker in prod).
5. Configure a security group to allow inbound traffic on port 80/443 and outbound to RDS.
6. (Optional) Put an Application Load Balancer + SSL (ACM) in front of EC2.
